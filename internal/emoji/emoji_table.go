// Package emoji paints thirty-one color emoji as inline images. The bundled
// text faces draw a few smileys in monochrome and tofu for the rest, so
// supported sequences are replaced with <img> tags that resolve to the
// bundled Twemoji 72px PNGs through the page image lookup. Form values
// keep the raw runes; only the paint carries images.
