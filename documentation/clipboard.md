# Clipboard

`clipboard.Write` stores the text in memory, then tries the OS clipboard unless tests have called `UseMemory(true)`. `clipboard.Read` returns the OS clipboard when that read works. Otherwise it returns the last `Write`.

The window still calls `Write` and `Read` for the text chords. Those signatures did not change. No Go module was added. The package does not start `wl-copy`, `xclip`, `pbcopy`, or PowerShell.

| Target | What `Write` and `Read` call |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Linux, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` set | Nothing. A Wayland data-device client is not in this tree. The memory copy is used. |
| Linux, `DISPLAY` set and Wayland unset | The X11 `CLIPBOARD` selection on `/tmp/.X11-unix/X<n>`. A goroutine answers `SelectionRequest` while this process owns the selection. `UTF8_STRING` is the type. |
| Linux, neither variable set | The memory copy |
| Windows | `user32` `OpenClipboard` / `SetClipboardData` / `GetClipboardData` and `kernel32` global memory. The format is `CF_UNICODETEXT`. |
| macOS, cgo on | `NSPasteboard` `generalPasteboard`, type `NSPasteboardTypeString` |
| macOS, cgo off | The memory copy |
| Android, iOS, wasm | The memory copy |

`Write` may read `~/.Xauthority` to connect to the X server. It does not create or change that file. If the socket or the handshake fails, `Write` keeps the memory copy and `Read` falls back to it.

Tests call `UseMemory(true)` before any `Write`, including `TestMain` in `internal/clipboard`. They do not touch the desktop clipboard.
