# Repaint

A click that changes one box used to rebuild and replay the whole page. Now
the page reports the box it changed and the window repaints only that box.
This is the automatic path. The manual path, a frame callback that edits an
operation, is in [frames.md](frames.md).

## The page reports the region

`Page.TakeDirty` returns the region that changed since the previous call, in
CSS pixels, and clears it. A handler can declare the id it changed with
`Invalidate`; for handlers that forget, the page diffs the previous display
list against the new one and unions the bounds of every changed operation.
An operation removed from the list dirties its old bounds, so a vanishing
element leaves no ghost. A change the page cannot place, such as a theme
switch or a `Load`, returns the whole frame, and so does a diff that changes
more than eight operations or covers more than a third of the frame.

```go
rect, ok := page.TakeDirty()
```

`ok` false means nothing changed since the previous call. The rect is
padded, so shadows and outlines repaint too.

## The window repaints the rect

`internal/replay.DrawRect` is `Draw` for one region. It walks `Display.Order`
the same way, skips any op whose painted box does not meet the rect, and
paints the ops it keeps into a sub-image of the destination. The sub-image
matters: the display list carries a page background fill that covers the
whole canvas and therefore meets every rect. Without the clip, that one op
would repaint the background over everything outside the dirty rect, and the
rest of the page would vanish until its own box is dirtied again.

```go
replay.DrawRect(dst, display, rect, dx, dy)
```

Text needs care. An op carries its baseline in `Y`, so `DrawRect` tests the
line box from the font ascent above the baseline to `InkDescent` below it,
not `Y` alone. Strokes and lines grow by half a stroke, and an op whose ink
cannot be bounded, such as a rotated run, is always drawn.

The window keeps one content-sized image for the replay path. The content is
the canvas grown to cover every box that overflows it, the same measure the
scroll clamp uses, so a page with a fixed root stays painted when it scrolls.
A dirty rect is filled with the page background and replayed into that
buffer, and the visible page is blitted from the buffer to the screen each
frame. The screen is cleared between frames, so the blit covers the viewport
and only the buffer repaint is partial. Scrollbar thumbs and the `bitmap
fallback` badge draw on the screen after the blit, so a repaint never wipes
them.

The buffer is rebuilt in full when the generation changes without a usable
rect, when the content changes size, and when the rect is the whole content. A
scroll offset change only moves the blit, so scrolling does not replay the
list.

## What still repaints in full

- A fallback page with no display list. `imageout.RenderLayout` paints the
  whole canvas, and a partial bitmap path needs a new engine call; the
  decision is recorded in
  [the plan](../plans/v0.0.2/incremental-repaint.md). The badge stays
  visible.
- A page with a frame callback. A tick changes operations in place and
  leaves no dirty rect, so `Page.Ticking` keeps the full replay.
- A stretched or zoomed page. `internal/window/replay_scale.go` replays the
  whole list into a canvas-sized buffer each frame and scales it to the
  window.
- `Page.PNG` paints from the template source on demand, so `GET /frame.png`
  always costs a full paint.

## Measured numbers

Against the examples in this tree, at 480x640, at this commit. The rect is
the element's box plus 8 px, and the count is the operations that meet it:

| Page | Ops | Repainted | Skipped |
|------|-----|-----------|---------|
| platform, `#count` | 11 | 5 | 6 |
| login, `#message` | 18 | 3 | 15 |
| states, `#hover-btn` | 16 | 4 | 12 |
| forms, `#remember` | 45 | 5 | 40 |

A full-canvas background meets every rect, so the repainted count is not the
whole story. The automatic diff rect is the changed operations' own bounds,
which is often tighter than the element box, and the ops it skips are the
small text and border runs a partial repaint exists to avoid. The op filter
runs at about 12 ns per op (`go test -bench BenchmarkDrawRectScan -v
./internal/replay`, which prints the platform counts). One `#inc` click
through the handler, the template execute, the relayout, and the dirty rect
measures about 0.5 ms on this machine (`BenchmarkClickCount` in the platform
example).
