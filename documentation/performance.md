# Performance

## Opt in first

Perf sampling is off by default, so a shipped app pays nothing for it. The DevTools PERFORMANCE, PIPELINE DETAIL, and MEMORY rows show "-" and `GET /debug/state` omits runtime until a developer opts in.

```go
page, err := gpui.NewWithOptions(gpui.Config{HTML: html, Width: 720, Height: 560}, gpui.WithPerf(true))
```

That one call covers the common case. The pieces behind it are `Config.Perf` on the page, `WindowOptions.Perf` on the window, and `ServeOptions{Perf: true}` for `ServeWithOptions` and its `/debug/pprof/*` endpoints. `Page.SetPerf` and `Page.Perf` flip and read the page flag at runtime. The window picks up a page with Perf on by itself, and `WindowOptions.Perf` turns on frame and runtime sampling even for a custom screen. The benchmark apps under `examples/perf-benchmarks` opt in already.

This page turns the release checklist into steps you can run. It assumes Perf is on and the DevTools Frame tab and `GET /debug/state` expose the counters named below. If a counter is missing, file it as a bug instead of guessing.

Record per release numbers in [performance-baseline.md](performance-baseline.md). Repaint internals live in [repaint.md](repaint.md). The Frame tab layout lives in [devtools.md](devtools.md).

## 1 Idle baseline

Leave the window alone for 30 to 60 seconds and confirm it does almost nothing.

Run the idle script against a benchmark app, wait for the window to settle, then read CPU and RSS with the system monitor while the window stays untouched. No input, no tick animation, no reload.

```sh
sh scripts/perf-idle.sh examples/perf-benchmarks/normal
```

A quiet page should sit near zero CPU. RSS should hold flat across the sample window. Write both numbers into the baseline table under Idle RSS and Idle CPU, with the machine name and the commit hash. Repeat on the same machine before comparing releases.

## 2 Frame budget and pipeline

A 60 fps window has 16.67 ms per frame. The PERFORMANCE section of the Frame tab breaks each frame into stages so a slow frame points at its cause.

The stages are template execute, layout, display list build, and paint or replay. The panel reports average, p95, and p99 frame time plus a count of long frames over budget. Open it with F12 or set `Config.DevTools` to true at startup.

A healthy normal page keeps p99 under budget with margin. When p95 passes budget, read the stage rows before changing code. Layout cost points at the engine relayout path. Paint cost points at the replay path. Template cost points at the app.

`GET /debug/state` carries the same fields in web mode for scripted capture.

## 3 Incremental repaint goal

A small change should do small work. One click edits one box, and the window repaints one rect.

The DIRTY section of the Frame tab proves it. It reports dirty rects taken, full frame fallbacks, operations repainted, and operations skipped. The page reports the changed region with `TakeDirty` and the window replays only that region with `replay.DrawRect`. [repaint.md](repaint.md) has the full path and the cases that still repaint in full, such as fallback pages and ticking pages.

For a single control change, expect one dirty rect, a small repainted count, and a large skipped count. A whole frame rect on every edit means the diff fell back, usually because more than eight operations changed or the change covered more than a third of the frame.

## 4 Soak matrix

Run one scenario for 10 to 30 minutes and watch memory and scheduling stay flat.

```sh
sh scripts/perf-longrun.sh examples/perf-benchmarks/normal
```

Cover each row at least once per release. Combine them in one session when time is short.

| Scenario | What to do |
|---|---|
| Resize | Drag the window edge slowly, pause, release, repeat |
| Scroll | Wheel through a tall page top to bottom and back |
| Click | Toggle one control every few seconds |
| Text | Type into one field, select, delete, repeat |
| Animate | Run the flappy benchmark with its tick on |
| Create and remove | Add and remove repeated rows or cards |

The MEMORY section of the Frame tab shows Go heap, total allocation, RSS, and goroutine count. The run passes when RSS and heap stay flat after warmup, GC cadence looks steady, and goroutines do not climb. A slow RSS climb across the whole run is a leak until proven otherwise. Capture a heap profile before and after when the numbers move.

## 5 DevTools perf panel fields

The Frame tab groups perf counters under three sections. Values come from `Page.Stats` through `host.Inspector`, so `GET /debug/state` returns the same data as JSON.

| Section | Rows |
|---|---|
| PERFORMANCE | Frame average, p95, p99, long frame count, per stage times for template, layout, display list, and paint |
| DIRTY | Dirty rects taken, full frame fallbacks, operations repainted, operations skipped |
| MEMORY | Go heap in use, total allocation, RSS, goroutine count, GC runs |

WINDOW, RENDERING, PIPELINE, and RELOAD rows stay as documented in [devtools.md](devtools.md). Perf sections add timing and memory on top of those counters, they do not replace them.

## 6 Benchmark apps

`examples/perf-benchmarks` holds three small apps with one job each. Each runs on desktop and with `-web`.

| App | What it stresses | Run |
|---|---|---|
| normal | A typical page with controls and text | `go run ./examples/perf-benchmarks/normal` |
| large | A heavy page with many boxes and rules | `go run ./examples/perf-benchmarks/large` |
| flappy | A ticking page that edits operations per frame | `go run ./examples/perf-benchmarks/flappy` |

Use normal for the idle baseline and the soak default. Use large to find layout and paint cliffs. Use flappy to find per frame allocation and tick cost. The baseline table records all three side by side so a change that helps one and hurts another shows up.

## 7 Baseline table per release

Fill [performance-baseline.md](performance-baseline.md) once per release, on the same machine when possible. Automated rows come from this script.

```sh
sh scripts/perf-baseline.sh
```

The script runs each benchmark app and writes idle, frame, allocation, layout, and paint rows. Manual rows, such as soak verdicts and machine notes, go in by hand. Never copy numbers across machines. Label every entry with the commit hash.

## 8 Measure before optimizing

No optimization lands without a number that asks for it.

The flow is short. Reproduce the slow case in a benchmark app. Read the PERFORMANCE and DIRTY sections to name the stage. Take a profile, change one thing, then remeasure with the same script and app.

CPU and heap profiles come from the profiler endpoint in web mode, served only when the app opted into Perf with `ServeOptions{Perf: true}`.

```sh
go tool pprof -top http://127.0.0.1:8091/debug/pprof/heap
go tool pprof -top http://127.0.0.1:8091/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30
```

Use the port the app actually serves. Keep the profile files next to the baseline entry when the change lands, and quote before and after numbers in the commit message.
