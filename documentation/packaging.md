# Packaging

`scripts/package.sh <example>` builds one example for this system and writes
a release archive to `dist/`. The build uses `-trimpath` and
`-ldflags "-s -w"`. The script makes no network calls and adds no modules.

```
sh scripts/package.sh print          # archive the print example
sh scripts/package.sh -n print       # print the layout, build nothing
```

The dry run prints the archive names and every entry, so you can check the
layout without a toolchain for the target. It still asks Go for `GOOS` and
`GOARCH`, so `GOOS=darwin sh scripts/package.sh -n print` prints the macOS
layout on any system.

## Archive layouts

Linux, a `tar.gz`:

```
ownframe-print-linux-amd64.tar.gz
  ownframe-print/print
  ownframe-print/print.desktop
  ownframe-print/README.md
```

macOS, a zip with an app bundle:

```
ownframe-print-macos-arm64.zip
  ownframe-print.app/Contents/Info.plist
  ownframe-print.app/Contents/MacOS/print
```

Windows, a zip with the executable:

```
ownframe-print-windows-amd64.zip
  ownframe-print.exe
```

wasm, on every system:

```
ownframe-print-wasm.zip
  ownframe.wasm
  wasm_exec.js
  index.html
```

`index.html` is the repository's `browser/index.html`. It loads
`ownframe.wasm` through `wasm_exec.js` from the same directory, so serve the
unpacked directory over HTTP.

`SHA256SUMS` sits next to the archives and covers the archives from the same
run. `scripts/package_test.sh` checks the dry-run layout against this file
and needs no build.

## Signing and notarization

The script ships unsigned archives. Each system treats one differently.

- Linux has no signing step. A `tar.gz` unpacks and runs.
- macOS Gatekeeper blocks an unsigned `.app` from an unknown developer on
  first launch. The person can right-click and choose Open, or you can sign
  and notarize outside the script with an Apple Developer certificate,
  `codesign`, `notarytool`, and `stapler`. That work needs an Apple account
  and belongs in your release pipeline.
- Windows SmartScreen warns on an unsigned `.exe` from an unknown publisher.
  An Authenticode certificate and `signtool` remove the warning, again
  outside this script.
- The wasm zip has no signing step; the browser trusts the server it came
  from.

Icons are the platform default. Custom icons need per-platform resource
tools for `icns` and `.ico` files, which this script does not include.

## Auto-update

Not included, and not planned for the library. A library cannot replace its
own host binary portably. A product that wants auto-update builds its own
`cmd/updater`: a signed manifest, a download, an atomic swap, and a restart.
That fights the OS stores and package managers that own the install.
