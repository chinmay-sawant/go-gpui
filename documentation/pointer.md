# Pointer

The window sends hover, press, release, and click events to a page. `internal/window/pointer.go` calls the page methods each frame, and a caller can call the same methods directly.

## Page methods

`Page.Hover(ctx, x, y)` sets the hovered id to the innermost box with an id at the point. A point that hits no box with an id clears it. It redraws only when the id changed.

`Page.Press(ctx, x, y)` sets the pressed id the same way and redraws only when it changed. `Page.Release(ctx)` clears the pressed id and redraws only when it was set.

`Page.Click(ctx, x, y)` hit-tests the last box that contains the point, which is the innermost box in document order. Then:

- A form control activates before the handler runs and never follows a route ([forms.md](forms.md)).
- Any other hit blurs the focused control.
- After a non-control hit, a non-empty `data-action` with a registered route loads that HTML and skips the handler ([navigation.md](navigation.md)).
- A nil `Click` handler ignores the event.
- An error from the handler or the load returns before the redraw. Otherwise the page redraws after the handler.

## Window mapping

The window sends hover every frame. A scrollbar interaction consumes the event before hover runs, so hover pauses while a thumb is pressed or dragged. Press and click both fire on the mouse-down edge; release fires on the mouse-up edge.

While the devtools overlay is on ([devtools.md](devtools.md)), hover pauses and a click pins the box under the cursor instead of reaching `Click`. Alt+click forwards the press and the click to the page. Closing the overlay sends one hover for the current cursor.

The coordinates arrive in page space, with the scroll offset added or the stretch scale applied ([scrolling.md](scrolling.md)).

A touch sends press, click, and release for each fresh touch, so a tap arrives as a click. A mouse click in the same frame suppresses the touch, so one tap is not delivered twice.

## CSS states

The hovered and pressed ids become the host states `:hover` and `:active`. `:focus` comes from clicks, not Tab. [forms.md](forms.md) lists the state attributes and the focus rules.
