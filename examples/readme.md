# Examples

Every example opens one HTML template in a window. `go run ./examples/<name>`
opens a desktop window. `go run ./examples/<name> -web` serves the same picture
in a browser on the printed address. Each example package also has a test that
runs headless. `examples/music` is shared code the players import, not an
example of its own.

The feature list these examples follow is
[../documentation/features-examples.md](../documentation/features-examples.md).

## Run

```sh
go run ./examples/layout          # desktop window
go run ./examples/layout -web     # browser on 127.0.0.1:8100
```

The platform example also builds for the browser canvas:

```sh
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build ./examples/platform
```

Cursor keys, Space, and the other game keys arrive at the page through
`Handlers.KeyDown` and `Handlers.KeyUp`; the dino example is keyboard-only,
while flappy-bird flaps on a key or a click.
`Ctrl+C`/`Ctrl+X`/`Ctrl+V`, `Ctrl+Z`, and `Ctrl+Y` are handled by the
window, not by the examples.

## Audio

The audio player and Spotify player play real music in the desktop window. On
play they resolve a royalty-free MP3 from the Openverse API
(`https://api.openverse.org`, no key), download it once into the user cache
directory, and play it through Ebiten audio while the frame tick moves the
seek bar and equalizer. `gpui.Run` and `gpui.BindMobile` create the Ebiten
audio context the player needs; `-web` has none. When Openverse is
unreachable the players fall back to a generated demo tune, so the controls
and the animation still work. Tests inject a fake engine and never touch the
audio device or the network.

## Tests

```sh
make test
```

`make test` runs `go test -p 1 ./...` by default so the packages do not all
build and run at once. Set `TEST_P` for more parallelism: `make test TEST_P=4`.
