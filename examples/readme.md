# Examples

Every example opens one HTML template in a window. `go run ./examples/<name>`
opens a desktop window. `go run ./examples/<name> -web` serves the same picture
in a browser on the printed address. Each example package also has a test that
runs headless. `examples/music` is shared code the player imports, not an
example of its own.

The feature list these examples follow is
[../documentation/features-examples.md](../documentation/features-examples.md).

## Dev loop

The reload example reads its HTML from disk, so the edit is the build step:

```sh
go run ./examples/reload
```

Edit `examples/reload/index.html` and the open window redraws within a quarter
second. The counter keeps its value. `-reload=false`
turns the watch off, and `-web` serves the same page in a browser. The
behavior and the limits are in
[../documentation/hot-reload.md](../documentation/hot-reload.md).

## Original examples

| Folder | Shows |
|---|---|
| [login](login) | Sign-in screen with real inputs, clipboard, and an app-level undo stack. |
| [forms](forms) | Every form control: text, password, textarea, checkbox, radio, select, file. |
| [bind](bind) | `data-bind` two-way binding of controls to a struct. |
| [input-lab](input-lab) | All nine form and input demos in one window: plain controls, two-way binding, a locked bound field, edit undo, OS clipboard, scroll list, sign-in, and CSS states. |

## Feature examples

| Folder | Feature | `-web` port |
|---|---|---|
| [perf-complex](perf-complex) | Complex 480-row performance baseline, optional live row windowing, and headless profiling with `-dump`. | 8135 |
| [layout](layout) | HTML -> CSS -> layout pipeline with hit-test boxes. | 8100 |
| [replay](replay) | Display-list replay and the bitmap fallback. | 8101 |
| [shapes](shapes) | Rounded and elliptical fills, masked strokes, letter-spaced text, caches. | 8102 |
| [png](png) | `Page.PNG` on-demand rasterization and caching. | 8103 |
| [controls](controls) | Click to focus, toggle, check, and cycle controls; typing edits; a file control opens the OS dialog. | 8104 |
| [bind-hooks](bind-hooks) | Two-way binding plus `BeforeEdit` veto and `Change` callback. | 8105 |
| [editing](editing) | Select all, undo, redo, and edits that survive a redraw. | 8106 |
| [states](states) | Host `:focus`, `:focus-visible`, `:hover`, `:active`, `:checked` styles. | 8107 |
| [scrolling](scrolling) | Oversized pages scroll on the wheel with scrollbar thumbs. | 8108 |
| [history](history) | `Load`, `Back`, `Forward`, `HTML`, and `data-action` routes. | 8109 |
| [web](web) | Web mode routes: `/`, `/frame.png`, `/debug/state`, `/click`, `/type`, `/backspace`. | 8110 |
| [ipc](ipc) | In-process `Send`, `Listen`, `Handle`, `Request`, with registered state and cancel. | 8111 |
| [fetch](fetch) | `Fetch` GET and `XHR` with method, headers, and body; a fetched PNG or JPEG becomes the page background. | 8112 |
| [clipboard](clipboard) | Copy, cut, paste, select all, undo, and redo through the page APIs. | 8113 |
| [crash](crash) | `Report` files and panic recovery by `Run`. | 8114 |
| [platform](platform) | One page on desktop, WebAssembly, and mobile. The counter click calls `Invalidate("count")`, so only that box repaints. | 8115 |
| [theme](theme) | `Config.Theme` and `SetTheme` restyle a running page; the toggle swaps custom properties. | 8116 |
| [wispr-flow-dashboard](wispr-flow-dashboard) | Wispr Flow app clone: collapsible sidebar with the Flow Pro logo, dictation history, notetaker, insights with usage/voice/leaderboard tabs, dictionary, snippets, style, transforms, scratchpad, invite, free month, settings, and help. UI only, sample data. | 8117 |
| [teams](teams) | Microsoft Teams-like app clone: dark theme by default with a light theme toggle, six rail menus (Activity, Chat, Teams and channels, Calendar, Calls, Files), a More apps flyout, a profile flyout with status, chat compose, live chat and search filtering, expandable channel threads with emoji reactions, a meeting card with date and time picks, a dial pad, and file details. The state persists in SQLite, the initial data comes from `examples/teams/store/seed/*.sql`, and `-db` selects the database file (`:memory:` keeps it in memory). Marvel-cast sample data. | 8118 |
| [spotify-player](spotify-player) | Dark Spotify-like player: eight screens (home, search, library, liked, browse, radio, queue, profile), live iTunes data, local free-music playback, and an animated now-bar equalizer. | 8119 |
| [telegram](telegram) | Telegram-like chat demo sized for a phone: chat list with search, contacts, settings with a dark theme, and one open conversation with a composer. The Android project under `telegram/android` builds an installable APK. | 8129 |
| [dino](dino) | Chrome-style dinosaur game: keyboard jump and duck, cacti and birds, running score, and a live frames-per-second readout. | 8120 |
| [flappy-bird](flappy-bird) | Flappy Bird: HTML/CSS scene, gravity and flap physics, scrolling pipe pairs, score and best, keyboard or click. | 8121 |
| [devtools](devtools) | Inspector dock: JSON element properties, frame counters, and operation outlines; F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I. | 8122 |
| [reload](reload) | File-backed page that redraws when `index.html` changes; the counter survives the reload. | 8123 |
| [drop](drop) | Dropped files print their absolute path on desktop and the entry name in a browser; a file control takes a path from the picker. | 8124 |
| [print](print) | Save the report as a PDF, print it through the OS print path, and serve `GET /pdf` in web mode. | 8125 |
| [input](input) | Focus traversal, caret keys, drag selection, context menu, cursor shapes, touch scroll and pinch, page scrolling, and F11. | 8126 |
| [input-lab](input-lab) | The nine form and input demos (forms, controls, bind, bind-hooks, editing, clipboard, input, login, states) in one window. | 8130 |
| [desktop-cat](desktop-cat) | Transparent orange backpack cat with 30 expression PNGs, native click-through, a notification server on 127.0.0.1:6969, and a WASM canvas preview; web mode is a still picture. | 8128 |
| [resize](resize) | Window resize: two columns switch at a media query, a 100vw bar, rewrapping text, and a hover control. | 8127 |

## Run

```sh
go run ./examples/layout          # desktop window
go run ./examples/layout -web     # browser on 127.0.0.1:8100
```

The platform example also builds for the browser canvas:

```sh
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build ./examples/platform
```

Cursor keys, Space, and the other game keys arrive at the page through
`Handlers.KeyDown` and `Handlers.KeyUp`; the dino example is keyboard-only,
while flappy-bird flaps on a key or a click.
`Ctrl+C`/`Ctrl+X`/`Ctrl+V`, `Ctrl+Z`, and `Ctrl+Y` are handled by the
window, not by the examples.

## Phone

`examples/telegram` is the phone-first example. `sh scripts/android.sh` binds
it with `ebitenmobile` and builds a debug APK with Gradle;
`sh scripts/android.sh install` also runs `adb install -r`. The one-time
Android SDK, NDK, and `ebitenmobile` setup is in
[telegram/android/README.md](telegram/android/README.md).

## Audio

The Spotify player plays real music in the desktop window. On play it resolves
a royalty-free MP3 from the Openverse API (`https://api.openverse.org`, no
key), downloads it once into the user cache directory, and plays it through
Ebiten audio while the frame tick moves the seek bar and equalizer.
`ownframe.Run` and `ownframe.BindMobile` create the Ebiten audio context the player
needs; `-web` has none. When Openverse is unreachable the player falls back to
a generated demo tune, so the controls and the animation still work. Tests
inject a fake engine and never touch the audio device or the network.

## Tests

```sh
make test
```

`make test` runs `go test -p 1 ./...` by default so the packages do not all
build and run at once. Set `TEST_P` for more parallelism: `make test TEST_P=4`.

## Perf benchmarks

| Folder | Shows | `-web` port |
|---|---|---|
| [perf-benchmarks/normal](perf-benchmarks/normal) | Benchmark A: small desktop form with a counter and a bound input, mostly idle. | 8131 |
| [perf-benchmarks/large](perf-benchmarks/large) | Benchmark B: thousand-row scrolling text list from one template range. | 8132 |
| [perf-benchmarks/flappy](perf-benchmarks/flappy) | Benchmark C: flappy-bird-like tick animation over retained display-list ops, space or click to flap. | 8133 |

The shared app code lives in `perf-benchmarks/benchutil`. The Go benchmarks
need no display:

```sh
go test ./examples/perf-benchmarks/ -run '^$' -bench . -benchmem
```

`BenchmarkNormalRedraw` times a warm small-form redraw,
`BenchmarkLargeRedraw` a warm thousand-row redraw alternating one pixel of
width, and `BenchmarkFlappyTick` one frame tick with no redraw.
